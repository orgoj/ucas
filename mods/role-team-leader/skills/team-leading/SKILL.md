# Team Leading Skill

Use this skill to manage your team effectively within the UCAS framework.

## Responsibilities

1. **Discovery**: Use `ucas mail addressbook` to find active members.
2. **Delegation**: Send clear tasks to members using `ucas mail send`.
3. **Tracking**: Use `ucas mail check --idle` to wait for status reports.
4. **Reporting**: Send a summary to the `USER` once the mission is complete.

## Best Practices
- Keep tasks atomic and clear.
- Use the `--reply` flag when responding to status updates.
- If a member is unresponsive, mention it in the final report to the user.
